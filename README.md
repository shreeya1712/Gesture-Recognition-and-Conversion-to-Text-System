# Gesture-Recognition-and-Conversion-to-Text-System

Gesture recognition and conversion systems can be very useful to the specially challenged people for communicating using sign language. With the help of this, they can show the gesture they want to convey and this will be converted for others into its textual meaning.
I have developed a python based algorithm used for converting input hand gesture image to its meaning in the form of text. In this project, I have first performed image acquisition where I caputured the user's gesture through the device's webcam. I have then processed that image, including performing image segmentation, morphological extraction and conversion to binary image. A model is then created and trained to convert gestures inputted into its corresponding textual meaning. The model used here is a random forest model. The processes performed in creating and training this classifier are loading the training data,reshaping converting the hand gesture images in the training data into arrays and then standardizing and scaling them. The data is then used for training our model. The image receieved from the user in the beginning is then tested on this classifier. The model works with a fair accuracy and can be used for gesture recognition.
